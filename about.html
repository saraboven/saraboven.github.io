          <p>I am 32 years old and currently undergoing an intensive programming course.
            I was born and raised in Madrid, where I studied Economics as a major degree
            and ever since, have been living and working abroad in Monterrey, Mexico for
            two years and in Munich, Germany for the past 4 years. While working in different
            fields, I finally realized I wanted a drastic change for me, and I have decided
            to focus into programming since its super interesting and clearly where the future
            labor market is moving to.</p>

            <p>I am passionate about travelling, I love to visit new places and learn about
              their different culture, traditions and ways of life. Every time I have, I am
              out there on the road, looking for new places to explore. Life has many twists
              and turns, full of spins and throwing you into different directions;
              I am convinced this is the right turn for me!</p>
